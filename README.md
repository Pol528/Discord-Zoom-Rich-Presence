# ZOOM DISCORD RICH PRESENCE
## How it works
Since i don't have access to the Zoom source code, this is an external app that checks if the zoom client is running and connects the RPC to discord.

## Setup
### You will need:
- Python 3.9
### Installing dependencies:
- `pip install subprocess`
- `pip install pypresence`
- `pip install colored`

### After all that is installed, you can run `main.py`

## Don't want to install python and dependencies?
### In that case you can download and run main.exe!
